An experienced data and business intelligence analyst, I am passionate about using data to solve complex problems with actionable insights. In addition to my work as a business intelligence analyst at Charles Schwab, I also facilitate for online courses for Boston University's MET Graduate Computer Science program, where I function as a teaching assistant for R courses. I enjoy not only acting as an educator in this role, but also as a student advocate and cheerleader to help them become successful data analysts and data scientists.

This website serves to showcase some of my projects and highlight the work I do in my free time.
